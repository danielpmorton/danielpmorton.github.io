  title: "Safe, Task-Consistent Manipulation with Operational Space Control Barrier Functions"
  venue: IROS, 2025
  description: "We introduce an Operational Space Control Barrier Function (OSCBF) framework that integrates safety constraints while preserving task-consistent behavior during manipulation. Our approach scales to hundreds of simultaneous constraints while retaining real-time control rates, ensuring collision avoidance, singularity prevention, and workspace containment even in highly cluttered and dynamic settings."

  title: "Task-Driven Manipulation with Reconfigurable Parallel Robots"
  venue: IROS, 2024
  description: "We present a manipulation planning method for ReachBot, a new form of space robot employing extendable booms for mobility in Martian lava tubes. Via a two-part optimization-based method, we determine the configuration of the robot (where to place the booms) as well as how much tensile force should be applied in each boom. Through this, we can reliably complete tasks even despite uncertainty, disturbances, and stochastic failure modes."

  title: "Open X-Embodiment: Robotic Learning Datasets and RT-X Models"
  venue: ICRA, 2024
  description: "We introduce the Open X-Embodiment Dataset, the largest robot learning dataset to date with 1M+ real robot trajectories, spanning 22 robot embodiments. We train large, transformer-based policies on the dataset (RT-1-X, RT-2-X) and show that co-training with our diverse dataset substantially improves performance."

  title: "DROID: A Large-Scale In-The-Wild Robot Manipulation Dataset"
  venue: RSS, 2024
  description: "We introduce DROID, the most diverse robot manipulation dataset to date. It contains 76k demonstration trajectories or 350 hours of interaction data, collected across 564 scenes and 84 tasks by 50 data collectors in North America, Asia, and Europe over the course of 12 months. We demonstrate that training with DROID leads to policies with higher performance and improved generalization ability."
