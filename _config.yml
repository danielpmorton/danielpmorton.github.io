# Welcome to Jekyll!

# This config file is meant for settings that affect your whole blog, values
# which you are expected to set up once and rarely edit after that. If you find
# yourself editing this file very often, consider using Jekyll's data files
# feature for the data you need to update frequently.
#
# For technical reasons, this file is *NOT* reloaded automatically when you use
# 'bundle exec jekyll serve'. If you change this file, please restart the server process.

# If you need help with YAML syntax, here are some quick references for you:

# Site settings
# These are used to personalize your new site. If you look in the HTML files,
# you will see them accessed via {{ site.title }}, {{ site.email }}, and so on.
# You can create any custom variable you would like, and they will be accessible
# in the templates via {{ site.myvariable }}.

description: >-
  I am a PhD candidate at Stanford University, where I work with [Marco Pavone](https://web.stanford.edu/~pavone/) in the [Autonomous Systems Lab](https://stanfordasl.github.io/). I'm interested in efficient planning and modeling methods for robotic manipulation, with an emphasis on space and novel hardware. Previously, I've worked with [Jeannette Bohg](https://web.stanford.edu/~bohg/) during my Master's, and [Rob Shepherd](https://orl.mae.cornell.edu/) in undergrad. I am also a current 2024 NASA Space Technology Graduate Research Fellow, and was a 2022 NSF Graduate Research Fellow.
